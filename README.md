# Project Overview

Mental Health Horizons is a site that provides mental health information and is targeted towards anyone seeking mental health advice and support in the UK. It consolidates multiple online mental health resources so information can be accessed in one place.

# Features #

## Index Page
### Navbar
The navbar offers users a clear, easily defined way to navigate the site. The user can choose to jump down the page to either the card or links sections. 

### Jumbotron
Below the navbar is a jumbotron with background image with the organisation name and a line of text about what they do.

### Cards
Below the jumbotron are 3 bootstrap card components which each consist of an image, heading, text and a button. The images depict the stress-relief top described below and the button opens a new tab with a linked page with further practical information.


## Links
Below the cards there is a section with two columns, for mental health information and helplines. In each there are 2 logos of organisations, which can be clicked to open the organisation's homepage in a new tab.
